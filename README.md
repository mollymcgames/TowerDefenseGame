# Tower Defense Game
Simple "Tower Defense" style game made in Unity.


## How to play
Controls are essentially "point and click". To play click to add towers on the map.
Add towers to the designated zones on the map.
You have a set health which is the number of hearts you have. This resets at the start of each level.
Different towers shoot different types of projectiles (coming soon). At the moment we have an archer tower that shoots arrows.
So far there are two types of enemies you can defeat but more are to come in the future.
