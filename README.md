Controls are essentially "point and click". To play click to add towers on the map.
Add towers to the designated zones on the map. There are unlimited number of towers only limited by the amount of money in the game you have.
You have a set health which is the number of hearts you have. This resets at the start of each level.
Different towers shoot different types of projectiles. 
The towers are: 
Laser towers, archer towers that fire arrows and different projectile towers such as catapult and slingshot towers. There are also magic towers.
There are a couple of types of enemies to defeat in each wave and in one level there enemies with higher health.
You can also sell a tower to gain some money or click to upgrade your tower. 
Once the wave is over and all the enemies are defeated you can click to continue to get to the next level.
